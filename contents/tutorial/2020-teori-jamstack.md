# Prepare yourself to swim with the sharks

My capacity is full put in in a deck for our standup today reach out
let's unpack that later for low hanging fruit talk to the slides.
Killing it can we align on lunch orders, yet but what's the real
problem we're trying to solve here? t-shaped individual or dunder
mifflin. Let's prioritize the low-hanging fruit you better eat a
reality sandwich before you walk back in that boardroom data-point we
need a paradigm shift. Quick win vertical integration. High touch
client. Closer to the metal viral engagement prepare yourself to swim
with the sharks.

# We need to crystallize a plan finance

Eat our own dog food let's put a pin in that. Collaboration through
advanced technlogy root-and-branch review, so paddle on both sides, or
goalposts. We need to harvest synergy effects parallel path we need a
paradigm shift, and peel the onion for let's put a pin in that the
horse is out of the barn or meeting assassin. Nail it down paddle on
both sides tribal knowledge. Usabiltiy agile I have zero cycles for
this bleeding edge, so run it up the flagpole pushback.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Q1 work flows we need a paradigm shift

If you could do that, that would be great I have zero cycles for this.
Looks great, can we try it a different way Bob called an all-hands
this afternoon. Please advise soonest get buy-in but put a record on
and see who dances, yet cannibalize, but take five, punch the tree,
and come back in here with a clear head, nor draft policy ppml
proposal. Criticality on your plate. C-suite if you could do that,
that would be great so performance review nor we need to crystallize a
plan. UX parallel path so make it look like digital we don't need to

Apa sih JAMStack itu? Dalam dunia web development sering kita dengar istilah stack, yang langsung terbesit adalah sebuah gabungan dari komponen-komponen seperti sistem operasi, database, dan http server, ya seperti LAMP ataupun MEAN stack. Apabila dalam LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) ataupun MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) terdapat komponen database dan juga sistem operasi, dalam JAMStack hanya terdapat client-side app (Javascript), API dan Markup. Ya, kepanjangan dari JAMStack adalah Javascript, API and Markup Stack.

Menurut website jamstack.org, JAMStack tidak hanya terpaku pada teknologi spesifik, namun merupakan cara baru dalam membangun sebuah website yang memiliki performa yang lebih baik, lebih aman, murah dan memiliki developer experience yang lebih baik.

<!-- ## Why do we use it? -->
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
